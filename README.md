Game Rules

Each player is trying to collect the most points. The default (and minimum) number of points required to win is 20. Press the "Throw Dice" button to roll the dice. The current value of the dice will appear in the middle of the screen. Points accumulate as you throw multiple times.
You can throw any number of times you like, but if you roll a 1, you lose all your collected points and you automatically pass the turn to your opponent. Press the "Save Points" button to save your collected points at the end of your turn and pass the turn to your opponent.
The player who saves the required number of points to win the game is declared the winner.
